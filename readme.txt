a new concept of mailto and tel links

== Description ==

mailgo [https://mailgo.dev](https://mailgo.dev) for WordPress

Instead of the classic behaviour of mailto and tel links, mailgo will show a modal with more possibilities!

For `mailto:` links there is the possibility to open Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail or copy the email address

For `tel:` links you can open Telegram, WhatsApp, Skype or copy the phone number!
